# MAD-Level05_Task01
Task 1 of the fifth level assignment in "Mobile Application Development" at the Amsterdam University of Applied Sciences (Computer Science, 5th semester).

## Task
We will be building an app which acts as a notepad in which you write down notes. Actually this version would not be a particularly useful notepad because, as you might notice from the image of the app running, it only shows one note. When you save a note, it over-writes the existing note.
